  "plain": "One of the defining artists of the 2010s, Taylor Alison Swift, born December 13th, 1989, is an American singer-songwriter and actress who has achieved success in both country and pop. Raised on a Christmas tree farm in Reading, Pennsylvania, Swift moved to Nashville, Tennessee at age fourteen to pursue a career in country music. Scott Borchetta signed Swift to his then-nonexistent label Big Machine Records after seeing her perform at the Bluebird Cafe in November 2004.\n\nSwift debuted in June 2006 with \u201cTim McGraw,\u201d an ode to a lover who would be leaving town. The song served as an introduction to her self-titled debut album, which touched upon topics like heartbreak and bullying Swift faced at school. Her honesty and relatability appealed to fans from all walks of life, and went on to become the longest-charting album of the 2000s, spending 227 weeks on the Billboard 200.\n\nSwift\u2019s sophomore effort, Fearless, came in November 2008 and cemented her status as a country superstar, while tracks like \u201cLove Story\u201d and \u201cYou Belong With Me\u201d also garnered mainstream attention. Not only did the record become her first number one, but it also became the most-awarded country album of all time, winning accolades such as the Grammy award for Album of the Year. Until Billie Eilish\u2019s 2020 win, then-20-year-old Swift was the youngest person to have ever received the honor.\n\nFollowing the success of Fearless, some had doubts about Swift\u2019s songwriting abilities, and Swift wrote her third album, Speak Now, alone to prove herself. It became the fastest-selling digital album by a female artist in the U.S., selling over 278,000 digital downloads in its first week, and although it lost critic\u2019s-choice awards like the ACM Album of the Year and Grammy for Best Country Album, it saw great success at fan-influenced shows like the Billboard Music Awards.\n\nBefore releasing Red in October 2012, Swift began straightening her signature curly hair, signaling a new era in her personal life and career. After going through a whirlwind heartbreak, she channeled her emotions into fan-favorite songs like \u201cAll Too Well,\u201d which Rolling Stone named as the best song of the 2010s. Despite being a cult-classic, Red infamously lost the Grammy for Album of the Year, pushing Swift to change her sound and approach to music.\n\nOctober 2014\u2019s 1989 was Swift\u2019s official entrance to the pop music scene, and it cemented her status as a musical titan, becoming the only album of 2014 to sell over a million copies in its first week and spending eleven non-consecutive weeks at #1. She also won the coveted Grammy for Album of the Year, using her acceptance speech to applaud hard-working women and becoming the first woman to win Album of the Year twice, and for different genres. Lead single \u201cShake It Off\u201d became one of her biggest hits, earning Swift her first diamond single by March 2020.\n\nAround the time of her triumphant Grammy win, Swift became entangled in a highly-publicized feud with rapper Kanye West, who claimed that his interrupting her speech at the 2009 Video Music Awards was what \u201cmade [her] famous\u201d on his track \u201cFamous.\u201d After standing up for herself and claiming West never told her he would call her a \u201cbitch\u201d on the song, the public turned against Swift and began calling her things like a \u201csnake\u201d and a liar on social media.\n\nFollowing the backlash, Swift took a hiatus from the spotlight, breaking her typical cycle of releasing an album every two years. During this time, Swift worked on songs like \u201cThis Is What You Came For,\u201d which she wrote for then-boyfriend Calvin Harris under a pseudonym, \u201cBetter Man,\u201d which she wrote for country group Little Big Town, and \u201cI Don\u2019t Wanna Live Forever,\u201d a collaboration with ZAYN that appeared in the film Fifty Shades Darker.\n\nIn August 2017, Swift took a DJ who groped her to court, after he tried to sue her for defamation. She counter-sued for a symbolic $1 and the jury decided in her favor. Swift told TIME that she went through with the trial to stand in solidarity with other survivors of sexual assault, which was especially poignant in the face of the #MeToo Movement that was rising at the time.\n\nJust days after the case concluded, Swift wiped her social media accounts to tease the release of \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d and her sixth studio album, November 2017\u2019s reputation. Despite the previous summer\u2019s conflict, the record had her biggest sales week to date, debuting at #1 and selling 1.2 million copies in the U.S. in its first week, more than all the other 199 albums on the Billboard chart combined. It also went on to become the best-selling U.S. album of 2018, despite its 2017 release, and won accolades like the American Music Award for Favorite Pop/Rock Album.\n\nreputation was Swift\u2019s last album with Big Machine Records before signing with Republic Records. Following her new contract, Scott Borchetta sold Big Machine Records to entertainment mogul Scooter Braun. Swift took to social media to describe her disappointment, but vowed to re-record the albums Braun purchased so she could be the full owner.\n\nSwift\u2019s dedication to artistic ownership became a large focus of the Lover era \u2014 she co-produced most tracks on the album, as well as directing or co-directing each music video, including \u201cME!\u201d and \u201cLover.\u201d Swift also became politically vocal, starting with an October 2018 Instagram post about the U.S. midterm elections and continuing with acts like her support of the LGBT community on \u201cYou Need to Calm Down.\u201d\n\nIn November 2019, the American Music Awards named Swift as the Artist of the Decade, and she performed a medley of some of her biggest hits at the ceremony. That night, she also beat Michael Jackson\u2019s record to become the artist with the most AMA wins in history, earning her 29th award. The next month, Billboard named Swift their Woman of the Decade.\n\nIn January 2020, Swift released Miss Americana, a documentary directed by Lana Wilson that offered fans an unprecedented glimpse into Swift\u2019s everyday life and decision to speak up about politics, alongside \u201cOnly The Young\u201d, a political track she wrote while recording Lover.\n\nIn July 2020, Swift released her eighth studio album, folklore, after announcing it the day before, making it her first \u201csurprise\u201d release. While most of her work is autobiographical, she notably focused on telling other people\u2019s stories throughout the record. She went on to release The Long Pond Studio Sessions on the streaming service, Disney+, where she performed folklore live for the first time. folklore won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in March 2021, making Swift the first woman and fourth artist overall to win Album of the Year three times.\n\nSwift released the follow-up project evermore in December 2020, expanding the stories she told on folklore as well as becoming her second surprise release. It featured collaborations with Bon Iver, who also appeared on folklore, her long-time friends in HAIM, and The National, whose member Aaron Dessner was a key collaborator and producer throughout both folklore and evermore.\n\n Swift shifted her focus to her back-catalog in 2021, vowing to rerecord her first six albums to regain legal ownership. She kicked off this release cycle with \u201cLove Story (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d in February 2021, which preceded the release of Fearless (Taylor\u2019s Version) in April. To make these releases more exciting for fans, she added \u201cVault\u201d songs that she never released to each rerecording.\n\nFor the second rerecord, Swift announced Red (Taylor\u2019s Version), which includes 30 songs, 9 of them being \u201cFrom the Vault,\u201d and was released on November 2021.\n\nSwift\u2019s tenth studio album, Midnights, was released on October 21st, 2022 and tells the stories of many sleepless nights scattered throughout her life.

   "description": {
    "plain": "Widely regarded as one of Swift\u2019s best songs, \u201cAll Too Well\u201d sees her picking up shards of memories after a gut-wrenching breakup. She jumps through time to reflect on her best and worst memories with her ex, making the listener feel as though they were there with the couple.\n\nSwift told Pop Dust that she began writing the song in a soundcheck for her 2011 tour in support of Speak Now. Co-writer Liz Rose explained that the song was initially 10-15 minutes long before she helped Swift pare it down, and Swift shared some of the original lyrics in a deluxe edition of her 2019 album, Lover.\n\nMelodically, this version of \u201cAll Too Well\u201d is more subdued than the version we hear on the album. This change is evident throughout the song. This version begins with a saccharine melody before building up to a steady drum beat, while the original is heavily backed by guitar.\n\nLyrically, the songs are also different. This ten minute version is more vitriolic and bitter, while the album version is bittersweet. The metaphors in Verse 2 are reminiscent of folklore/evermore era Taylor, rather than Red era, with comparisons to bolder themes like death and tragedy rather than just the specific memories present in the original.\n\nMany believe Swift took inspiration from her relationship with actor Jake Gyllenhaal \u2014 the secret message \u201cMaple Lattes\u201d is hidden in the song\u2019s liner notes, and the two shared those coffees in November 2010. In a 2015 interview with Howard Stern, Gyllenhaal claimed to not know that Swift wrote a song about him, though she seemingly told Vulture he reached out to her after hearing the album.\n\n\u201cAll Too Well\u201d was the fourth song to contribute to Swift\u2019s \u201cTrack Five pattern,\u201d a pattern fans have noted where she puts one of the most emotive songs on an album as the fifth track. Previous examples were \u201cCold As You,\u201d \u201cWhite Horse,\u201d and \u201cDear John.\u201d\n\nAs a tribute to her fans and the massive impact this song had on her personal and professional life, Swift wrote and produced a short film for the song, starring Sadie Sink and Dylan O'Brien."

       "plain": "Widely regarded as one of Swift\u2019s best songs, \u201cAll Too Well\u201d sees her picking up shards of memories after a gut-wrenching breakup. She jumps through time to reflect on her best and worst memories with her ex, making the listener feel as though they were there with the couple.\n\nSwift told Pop Dust that she began writing the song in a soundcheck for her 2011 tour in support of Speak Now. Co-writer Liz Rose explained that the song was initially 10-15 minutes long before she helped Swift pare it down, and Swift shared some of the original lyrics in a deluxe edition of her 2019 album, Lover.\n\nMelodically, this version of \u201cAll Too Well\u201d is more subdued than the version we hear on the album. This change is evident throughout the song. This version begins with a saccharine melody before building up to a steady drum beat, while the original is heavily backed by guitar.\n\nLyrically, the songs are also different. This ten minute version is more vitriolic and bitter, while the album version is bittersweet. The metaphors in Verse 2 are reminiscent of folklore/evermore era Taylor, rather than Red era, with comparisons to bolder themes like death and tragedy rather than just the specific memories present in the original.\n\nMany believe Swift took inspiration from her relationship with actor Jake Gyllenhaal \u2014 the secret message \u201cMaple Lattes\u201d is hidden in the song\u2019s liner notes, and the two shared those coffees in November 2010. In a 2015 interview with Howard Stern, Gyllenhaal claimed to not know that Swift wrote a song about him, though she seemingly told Vulture he reached out to her after hearing the album.\n\n\u201cAll Too Well\u201d was the fourth song to contribute to Swift\u2019s \u201cTrack Five pattern,\u201d a pattern fans have noted where she puts one of the most emotive songs on an album as the fifth track. Previous examples were \u201cCold As You,\u201d \u201cWhite Horse,\u201d and \u201cDear John.\u201d\n\nAs a tribute to her fans and the massive impact this song had on her personal and professional life, Swift wrote and produced a short film for the song, starring Sadie Sink and Dylan O'Brien."

Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor\u2019s Version) [From the Vault] Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI walked through the door with you, the air was cold\nBut somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow\nAnd I left my scarf there at your sister's house\nAnd you've still got it in your drawer, even now\n\n[Verse 2]\nOh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze\nWe're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate\nAutumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place\nAnd I can picture it after all these days\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThat magic's not here no more\nAnd I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all\nOh, oh, oh\n\n[Chorus]\n'Caus\u0435 there we ar\u0435 again on that little town street\nYou almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me\nWind in my hair, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n\n[Verse 3]\nPhoto album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red\nYou used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed\nAnd your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team\nYou taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me\nAnd you were tossing me the car keys, \"Fuck the patriarchy\"\nKeychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town\nAnd I was thinkin' on the drive down, \"Any time now\nHe's gonna say it's love,\" you never called it what it was\n'Til we were dead and gone and buried\nCheck the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same\nAfter three months in the grave\nAnd then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you\nBut all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame\nSee Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $290You might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThere was nothing else I could do\nAnd I forget about you long enough\nTo forget why I needed to\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night\nWe're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light\nDown the stairs, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd there we are again when nobody had to know\nYou kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath\nSacred prayer and we'd swear\nTo remember it all too well, yeah\n\n[Bridge]\nWell, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much\nBut maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up\nRunnin' scared, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd you call me up again just to break me like a promise\nSo casually cruel in the name of bein' honest\nI'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here\n'Cause I remember it all, all, all\n[Verse 4]\nThey say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell\nEvery time you double-cross my mind\nYou said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine\nAnd that made me want to die\nThe idea you had of me, who was she?\nA never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you\nNot weepin' in a party bathroom\nSome actress askin' me what happened, you\nThat's what happened, you\nYou who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes\nSippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show\nBut then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come\nAnd he said, \"It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one\"\n\n[Verse 5]\nTime won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it\nI'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it\nAfter plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own\nNow you mail back my things and I walk home alone\nBut you keep my old scarf from that very first week\n'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me\nYou can't get rid of it\n'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again when I loved you so\nBack before you lost the one real thing you've ever known\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, you were there\nYou remember it all\nDown the stairs, you were there\nYou remember it all\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n\n[Verse 6]\nAnd I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes\n\"I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age\"\nFrom when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones\nI'm a soldier who's returning half her weight\nAnd did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you too?\n'Cause in this city's barren cold\nI still remember the first fall of snow\nAnd how it glistened as it fell\nI remember it all too well\n\n[Outro]\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?\nJust between us, do you remember it all too well?\nJust between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh)\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it (All too well)\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it217Embed"
