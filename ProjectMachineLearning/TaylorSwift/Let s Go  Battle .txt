Let s Go  Battle  Lyrics Verse    The first shot s fired  everybody s gathered around You re looking at me like I tried to take you down No  no  that s not what happened at all There s no sound  I m waiting on your next move A showdown and I know where to hit you But no  no  it s not how I wanted this to go down   Pre Chorus  Now we re standing in the ring And you make the first swing And now we re fighting dirty Won t somebody come say   Break it up    Chorus  And I used to be on your side Now it s looking like we re going to battle And why you taking shots at me like Somebody s gonna give you a medal  And I never wanna hurt you But I m tired of taking all these blows And so I d rather be on your side But if you wanna fight Baby  let s go  oh  oh Let s go  oh  oh   Verse    So gloves off  if this is how you want it We had it all  but you couldn t keep a promise No  no  I m not the one who tore us apart Let me remind you for a minute why we re not fine Is she here  Is she standing on the sidelines  Oh  oh  can t you tell this is breaking my heart    Pre Chorus  Now we re standing in the ring And you make the first swing And now I m fighting dirty But I ain t going down  til they break it up See Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as     You might also like Chorus  And I used to be on your side Now it s looking like we re going to battle And why you taking shots at me like Somebody s gonna give you a medal  And I never wanna hurt you But I m tired of taking all these blows And so I d rather be on your side But if you wanna fight Let s go  oh  oh Let s go  oh  oh   Bridge  Now we re standing in the ring Breaking everything that we ve been building up so long And I don t wanna do this  break it up But you re not who I thought you were And this is looking more like a war Looks like we re going to war   Chorus    And I used to be on your side Now it s looking like we re going to battle And I m trying not to break down crying No one s gonna give you a medal And I never wanna hurt you But I m tired of taking all these blows And so I d rather be on your side I d rather be on your side But if you wanna fight Baby  let s go  oh  oh Looks like we re going to war Oh  oh  Outro  The first shot s fired  everybody s gathered around You re looking at me like I tried to take you down No  no  but if you wanna fight  baby  let s go Embed
