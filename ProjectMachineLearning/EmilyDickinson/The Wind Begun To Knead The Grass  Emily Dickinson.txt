824
[first version]
The Wind begun to knead the Grass 
As Women do a Dough 
He flung a Hand full at the Plain 
A Hand full at the Sky 
The Leaves unhooked themselves from Trees 
And started all abroad 
The Dust did scoop itself like Hands 
And throw away the Road 
The Wagons quickened on the Street 
The Thunders gossiped low 
The Lightning showed a Yellow Head 
And then a livid Toe 
The Birds put up the Bars to Nests 
The Cattle flung to Barns 
Then came one drop of Giant Rain 
And then, as if the Hands
That held the Dams had parted hold 
The Waters Wrecked the Sky 
But overlooked my Father's House 
Just Quartering a Tree 
[second version]
The Wind begun to rock the Grass
With threatening Tunes and low 
He threw a Menace at the Earth 
A Menace at the Sky.
The Leaves unhooked themselves from Trees 
And started all abroad
The Dust did scoop itself like Hands
And threw away the Road.
The Wagons quickened on the Streets
The Thunder hurried slow 
The Lightning showed a Yellow Beak
And then a livid Claw.
The Birds put up the Bars to Nests 
The Cattle fled to Barns 
There came one drop of Giant Rain
And then as if the Hands
That held the Dams had parted hold
The Waters Wrecked the Sky,
But overlooked my Father's House 
Just quartering a Tree
